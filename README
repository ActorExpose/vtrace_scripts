Sample scripts using the vtrace API

NOTES:
To run these scritps you need the latest version of vdb from:
http://visi.kenshoto.com/releases/

Untar the latest version and update the VDB_ROOT in the scripts to make them work.

##
simpleAPI
    List of functions to use as reference on how to accomplish specific tasks.

simpleAttach
    Script that attaches to a given PID and continues execution of the program.

simpleDisasm
    Script that converts a string of hex data to assembly output.

simpleFollowChild
    Script that follows a child process created from CreateProcessA in windows.  Will breakpoint on the first instruction executing in the child process.

simpleFunctionList
    Script that outputs all the functions in a dll.

simpleIAT
    Prints out the import table for the given executable.

simpleIAT_NX
simpleIAT_NX_vdb
    Extension of simpleIAT script.  Scripts will set the IAT of a binary to unreadable causing a signal to be thrown on each external library reference and call.  The signal is then caught by a custom notifier class that will log them into a list in the order they were called, and continue the program.  Once process ends it will print out the list of called functions.
    The difference between the two scripts is that simpleIAT_NX_vdb is meant to be started within an already running vdb instance, simpleIAT_NX can be run from a commandline directly.

simpleNotifier
    Script that implements a notifier class to output data when specific signals are caught.

simpleOEP
    Script that parses the PE headers and calculates Original Entry Point (OEP).

simpleReg
    Script that prints out the current values of some registers.

simpleRet
    Calculates the return address of a function upon entering into the function.

simpleRun
    Script showing how to start a program with the debugger attached and continue execution.

simpleSnapshot
    Takes a snapshot of memory after a process is run to OEP.  Saves the snapshot to a file called zTest.snap.

simpleStalker
    Uses the stalker functionality within vtrace.

simpleStalker_ChildProc
    Uses the stalker functionality to stalk a child process.  Combination of the simpleFollowChild and simpleStalker scripts.

ida_stalker
    Will colorize an IDA graph based on the contents of simpleStalker output.  
    Does NOT account for the change of base addresses yet.
